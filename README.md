# About
An unofficial pytorch implementation of CVPR2021 paper "Checkerboard Context Model for Efficient Learned Image Compression".

This project is based on CompressAI, **"mbt2018 + checkerboard"** is implemented in `model.py`.

# Usage

## enviroment
python 3.7

compressai 1.2.0

## demo
Due to the limitation of file size in github, you should download checkpoint from [Google dirve](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E9bKGTGxHcR5F35WSB1vMcyt664MvCRm/), and then put it into the project fold.

```bash
pip install compressai
python demo.py
```
